# Bootcamp

The basics of writing code, starting with some code.

Recommended order of reading

- [Variables in Python](python/01_vars.py)
- [Loops in Python](python/02_loops.py)
- [Logic in Python](python/03_logic.py)

After digesting the Python code, try reading some Javascript

- [Variables in Javascript](javascript/01_vars.js)
- [Loops in Javascript](javascript/02_loops.js)

And for a bonus, some [Swift](others/01_vars_and_loops.swift).

At this point it should become clear that there are a number of languages (Python, Javascript, Swift, etc.) with different syntaxes, but the concepts are the same.

## TODO
